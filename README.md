Get Tempo
=========

Quickly measure the tempo of something by pressing a button.

When the Measure button is "Active", press the "Beat" button using mouse or
Space or Enter key once per beat. Turn on "Tempo√ó2" if you can't catch up.
After several times, the BPM is calculated and displayed in the box.
